The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the project configuration is incorrect or missing. For example, if the `google-services.json` file is missing or has incorrect data, the app may fail to initialize or connect to Firebase.  Another common error stems from improper use of asynchronous operations, especially when dealing with database interactions.  Not handling promises correctly (e.g., missing `.then()` or `.catch()` blocks) can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
